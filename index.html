     <p> What is HTML?</p> HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web
      pages. HTML gives authors the means to: Publish online documents with
      headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc. Retrieve online information
      via hypertext links, at the click of a button. Design forms for conducting
      transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information,
      making reservations, ordering products, etc. Include spread-sheets, video
      clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
      With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The
      elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,”
      “list,” “table,” and so on.
    </p>
    <p>What is CSS?
        CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

      The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the
      standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
      browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
      (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive
      HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
      documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
      page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
      document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
      constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
      embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and
      input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
      Psurround and provide information about document text and may include
      other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use
      them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written
      in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
      content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of
      content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the
      HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
      of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
      content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
      content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file
      which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well
      as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of
      formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
      page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
      on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
      and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
      formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name
      cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
      style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
      This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
      maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
      (MIME type) is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The
      W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In addition
      to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML,
      plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
